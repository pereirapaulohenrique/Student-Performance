## Title
Students Performance Linear Regression

## Description
This project replicates the Linear Regression chapter from the book "Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-learn, Keras, and Tensorflow" using the Student_Performance dataset. The goal is to practice and understand linear regression principles by predicting a student's performance index based on various factors.

## Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
- Student_Performance.csv: This dataset contains information about students' grades, study habits, and extracurricular activities.

## Implementation
1. **Data Acquisition**
2. **Data Cleaning**
3. **Data Exploration**
4. **Feature Engineering**
5. **Model Training**
6. **Model Selection**
7. **Model Evaluation**
8. **Model Saving**

## Key Findings
- Linear Regression achieved the best performance.
- Complex models might underperform due to simple relationships in the data.

## Future Work
- Explore other machine learning algorithms.
- Implement hyperparameter tuning.
- Include visualizations and interactive elements.
